### Project 4: Sentiment Analysis with Python and NLP using Amazon Software Reviews dataset
- This project focuses on customer sentiment analysis using Amazon Review Data on Software products to understand customer feelings about the brands and products through their reviews. 
- The project is implemented based on the CRISP-DM model through 5 phases, including Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, and Evaluation. All the phases will be implemented using NLTK and Scikit-learn in Python.
- In my project, four notebooks are created to perform all CRISP-DM phases:
   - [01.Main Notebook](https://github.com/TanThienNguyenVN/Project4_PythonNLP_SentimentAnalysis_AmazonSoftwareReviews/blob/main/TanThienNguyen_PythonNLP_01_MainNotebook.ipynb) : Main report, Business Objectives, Data Mining goals and the summary of the project
   - [02.Data Understanding](https://github.com/TanThienNguyenVN/Project4_PythonNLP_SentimentAnalysis_AmazonSoftwareReviews/blob/main/TanThienNguyen_PythonNLP_02_DataUnderstanding.ipynb) : Data Collection, Data Wrangling, EDA
   - [03.Data Preparation](https://github.com/TanThienNguyenVN/Project4_PythonNLP_SentimentAnalysis_AmazonSoftwareReviews/blob/main/TanThienNguyen_PythonNLP_03_DataPreparation.ipynb) : Data Cleaning, Data Normalization, WordCloud
   - [04.Modeling and Evaluation](https://github.com/TanThienNguyenVN/Project4_PythonNLP_SentimentAnalysis_AmazonSoftwareReviews/blob/main/TanThienNguyen_PythonNLP_04_Modeling%26Evaluation.ipynb) : Data Preprocessing, Modeling and Evaluation
- Now, let's get started [01.Main Notebook](https://github.com/TanThienNguyenVN/Project4_PythonNLP_SentimentAnalysis_AmazonSoftwareReviews/blob/main/TanThienNguyen_PythonNLP_01_MainNotebook.ipynb)
